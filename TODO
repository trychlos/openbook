   5 2014- 5- 2 ofa.doap: have a mailing list

   7 2014- 5- 2 have a preference to set the application menu on the
                top bar (gnome-shell) or on the main windows

  21 2014- 5- 6 DossierNew: let the user be able to choose to
                create a new database (if the data provider allows it)
                or to use an existing one
     2014- 7-14 when using an existing database, have an option to
                reinitialize it, or to use it as is

  41 2014- 5-12 ofaMainWindow: set menu tooltips

  43 2014- 5-12 ofaMainWindow left pane: should display a big icon and
                a label instead of only a text

  49 2014- 5-15 All properties: monitor "notes" size so
                that we stop the entering at 512 chars
     2014- 6-21 at 4096 chars now...
     2015-10- 6 monitoring works and doesn't allow more than 4095 chars
                but keep emitting a Gtk-Warning

  85 2014- 5-21 Color the frame of the invalid GtkEntry
                + set data "ofa-data-entry-valid"
                + my_utils_entry_is_valid
                + my_utils_entry_set_valid
     2014- 5-22 see also (cancelled) todo #20

  89 2014- 522 Guided input: have a transaction when writing the new
               entries so that we can rollback in case of an error

 126 2014- 5-28 have several demo dossiers

 152 2014- 6- 3 import qif files

 153 2014- 6- 3 import ofx/ofc files

 215 2014- 6-13 assets management
     2014- 6-16 to be built as a plugin

 217 2014- 6-13 tableau de trésorerie
     2014-10- 6 this may require the balance be printed
     2014-10- 6 this should be implemented as a plugin

 253 2014- 6-24 editing rough entries: have a 'select' button besides 
                of the account number when editing an entry

 254 2014- 6-24 editing rough entries: have a 'select' button besides
                of the ledger mnemo when editing an entry

 255 2014- 6-23 editing rough entries: add a button to revert the 
                modifications
 
 256 2014- 6-23 editing rough entries: add an icon to advertise that 
                the row has been modified
     2015- 2- 5 the entry is saved as soon as the edition finishes
                so there would be an added value if and only if we
                would have a modification history and would be capable
                of going back...

 259 2014- 6-23 editing rough entries: copy/paste a line

 273 2014- 6-29 ofa.css: hack ofaTabLabel/GtkGrid/GtkButton/GtkImage 
                styles

 312 2014- 9-22 myEditableAmount: should limit the count of decimals

 313 2014- 9-22 myEditableAmount: should have a format string to
                display a 'decoration' when rendering (e.g. a unit, or
                a standard prefix, or a display format)

 314 2014- 9-26 have a preference to use millenary shortcut
                (i.e. entering '14' gives '2014')

 325 2014-10-12 DossierManage Properties: to be written

 333 2014-10-18 ViewEntries, Reconciliation: two main pages which display
                a GtkTreeView with debit/credit amount columns:
                homogeneize the display (frame), define a footer bar,
                updating the right decalage as far as columns are 
                displayed

 334 2014-10-18 homogeneize styles:
                e.g. displaying validated entries in ofaViewEntries or
                validated balances if AccountProperties should have the
                same font/background
                + may be useful to use styles ?

 335 2014-10-18 some columns are displayed in several pages/dialogs,
                and should have the same display properties (e.g.
                piece reference, label, debit/credit, etc.) -> the 
                treeview setup should be factorized

 336 2014-10-18 all treeview columns in main pages should be resizeable
                (autoresize on double click is automatically handled)
                and the current width should be kept in settings
     2015- 1-22 no GtkTreeViewColumn primitive for setting a width ??

 442 2014-11-13 AccountsBook: add a notes indicator
     2014-12-19 started with svn #4348
                bug left: no background on highlighted rows...

 445 2014-11-13 my_date: do not accept two successive '/'
     2014-11-23 done - svn #4145
     2015- 1- 8 opened back as doesn't work

 461 2014-11-24 ExportAssistant: implement 'on_new_profile'

 462 2014-11-26 move ofoBat/ofoBatLine to ofaBoxed
     2015- 1- 5 really only required when ofoBat/ofoBatLine will implement
                the ofaIExportable interface - so it is not urgent

 494 2014-12- 4 ExeClosing: have a dossier option to have only one  
                centralisation entry when balancing the accounts, or
                have one entry per account
     2014-12- 7 maybe in a next version...

 513 2014-12- 9 whether balancing accounts are settleable or 
                reconciliable (and shouldn't) has to be checked when 
                setting these accounts for balance

 525 2014-12-13 when importing entries: review the code to be faster
                import accounts: 0.02286 s/row - 0.02316 s/row (127 rows)
                import ledgers:  0.02982 s/row (9 rows)
                import entries:  0.13268 s/row (2431 rows)
                import entries:  0.13237 s/row (1985 rows)
     2015- 1- 9 problem is the same when closing ledgers
     2015- 1-10 idem when validating entries:
                count=484: average is 0.09846 s

 553 2015- 1- 6 deleting a dossier only removes its references from
                settings - so DossierDelete and DossierDeletePrefs
                become useless (see also #522)

 559 2015- 1- 8 have a macro language to automate dossier creation,
                import of files
     2016- 1-27 other use case: automatically print the reports on
                period closing

 567 2015- 1- 9 have an EntryStore ?
     2015- 1-18 - ofaViewEntries add its own columns to its store
                - ofaReconciliation is a tree store with bat lines
                so the usefulness has yet to be proved...

 584 2015- 1-12 ofo_insert_entry: should also insert reconciliation and
                settlement data groups if they are set in the object
                (would prevent two updates when closing the exercice)

 599 2015- 1-22 GtkFileChooser in an assistant: unable to select again
                the previously selected file when coming back from an
                other page

 601 2015- 1-24 ExerciceClose: reset BAT files and lines from the new
                database
     2016- 4-20 see also #886

 632 2015- 2- 8 desktop file: use prefix when installing icon elsewhere
                than standard prefix=/usr
     2016- 1-25 icon is installed in $(datadir)

 652 2015- 2-15 let the user configure colors
     2015- 3-13 (branch colors) doesn't know how to go back from custom 
                in GtkColorChooserWidget (this is bad)
                + have to decide whether dossier color is a user pref
                or a dossier pref (for all users of this dossier)

 656 2015- 2-17 OpeTemplate page: have a shortcut on each tab

 684 2015- 2-21 MainWindow left pane: these are shortcuts which should
                be choosable by the user among the defined features

 706 2015- 3- 9 be able to configure some user shortcuts (in particular,
                it would be easier that row-activate on templates page
                opens the guided input rather that the properties)

 707 2015- 3- 9 it would be easier to be directly in overwrite mode
                (and to better manage it) when entering a date: this
                would prevent the user to have to first select the digits
                to be changed

 714 2015- 3-11 associate an account with a piece ref
                (e.g. ESP->531, CCP->51441, and so on)

 720 2015- 3-13 FEAT Reconciliation: when declining a proposition,
                     should search for the next

 733 2015- 3-15 FEAT be able to search for an entry

 758 2015- 3-21 FEAT warns when deleting a settled or reconciliated
                     entry +unsettle/unreconciliate

 761 2015- 3-22 DISP in the warning displayed when restoring to a
                     database, display the target database in bold (or
                     red)

 783 2015- 4- 3 FEAT have a summary of unsettle/unreconciliated entries
                     which will be reported after exercice closing
     2016- 4-28 use case: when preparing the exercice closing, have a
                direct view of unsettled entries on settleable accounts
                + idem for unreconciliated on reconciliable

 790 2015- 4- 6 DISP GuidedInputEx: replace the treeview by a revealer ?

 792 2015- 4- 6 FEAT have a comment in the backup

 796 2015- 4-13 FEAT IRenderable: have a second level of grouping
                     (subgroup) use case: when printing accounts book,
                     have a subtotal per class

 799 2015- 4-13 DISP AccountsBook account top and bottom reports:
                     - add a label [bottom report] or [top report] ?
                     - in italic ?
                     - added to the account label or rigt-aligned before the
                       debit ?

 808 2015- 4-17 DISP when rendering, automatically computes the width of 
                     standard field as date or amount
     2015- 4-20      depending of the different headers and footers of
                     the current print, this should involve selecting the
                     ad-hoc font before computing the size

 809 2015- 4-17 FEAT when computing the ODs, do not generate an OD for
                     "forfait kilométrique BNC" when option is "FR"

 810 2015- 4-17 FEAT when computing the ODs, the "Frais réels du
                     véhicule" should distinguish HT and TVA (but, yes,
                     compute on TTC)

 812 2015- 4-17 FEAT libellé des écritures d'amortissement: ajouter le
                     numéro d'annuité et le nb total (#7 - 3/4)

 821 2015- 4-27 ARCH check that concenating strings doesn't override the
                     limit (as the MySQL truncation may make the string
                     invalid utf-8) and take care to truncate to a valid
                     utf-8

 822 2015- 4-27 FEAT Review "solde at 01/01": these are not accounts
                     balances after entries from 01/01, but opening
                     exercice after carried forward entries *only*

 824 2015- 9-22 PACK use AX_COMPILER_FLAGS

 825 2015- 9-22 PACK use AM_GNU_GETTEXT instead of AM_GLIB_GNU_GETTEXT

 862 2015-10- 7 DISP fix focus order on GtkBin-derived widgets on the
                     assistants
                     - RestoreAssistant: dossier treeview after created
                       a new dossier
                     - administrative credentials

 886 2015-11- 7 FEAT ExerciceClosing: purge reconciliation groups when
                     both bat files and entries are purged
     2016- 4-20 see also #601

                     that it may automatically update window title

 910 2015-11-30 FEAT let the user configure the main title components as
                     a preference

 920 2015-12-10 FEAT review RestoreAssistant
                     + let restore on a selected exercice rather than on
                     the current one

 938 2015-12-21 ARCH distinguish a core api with core objects (eg. for
                     command-line only tools) and a ui api which contains
                     some base classes and interfaces which would be useful
                     for plugins => implies to have a core lib and a ui lib
     2015-12-27      have to choose between api/ui or api-ui styles

 956 2016- 1- 6 PACK add to make distcheck a script which checks that
                     -def includes are always used in headers (and only)

 966 2016- 1-10 FEAT tva/ofoTVARecord: make it printable

                     when the amount is set, but one of another field is
                     wrong

1012 2016- 2-25 FEAT GuidedInput: when a row is moved up or down, then
                     the indexes should be updated accordingly

1014 2016- 2-26 FEAT ViewEntries: filter per operation template

     2016- 5- 2 use case: maintain the misc-collector UI up to date

1102 2016- 5- 1 my_utils_widget_style_xx: is not consistent with a CSS
