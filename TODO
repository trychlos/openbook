                create a new database (if the data provider allows it)
                or to use an existing one

                the executed SQL statements

  35 2014- 5-10 DossierOpen should monitor the configuration, only
                enabling the action when there is at least one defined
                dossier
     2014- 5-22 see also TODO #42

  36 2014- 5-11 win.close action should only be enabled when a dossier

                a label instead of only a text

  49 2014- 5-15 All properties: monitor "notes" size so
                that we stop the entering at 512 chars
     2014- 6-21 at 4096 chars now...

  52 2014- 5-17 change the title of the pages of the models notebook
                when the label of a journal is changed

  57 2014- 5-19 have an entry-derived class for numbers (amounts and
                rates)

  58 2014- 5-19 allow the treeviewes to be sorted
     2014- 6-12 this is mostly needed only in ViewEntries

  60 2014- 5-19 manage locale as a user preference (format for entering
                date, amounts and rates)

  61 2014- 5-19 manage dataserver locale as a user preference (format 
                for storing date, amounts and rates) - this is rather
                a configuration information than actually a user pref..

  79 2014- 5-21 replace memcpy with g_memdup when possible
     2014- 6-27 all memcpy are used for copying GDate of timestamp, so
                are to be replaced with my_utils_date_set_from_date()
                or my_utils_stamp_set_from_???()

  85 2014- 5-21 Color the frame of the invalid GtkEntry
                + set data "ofa-data-entry-valid"
                + my_utils_entry_is_valid
                + my_utils_entry_set_valid
     2014- 5-22 see also Todo #20

  86 2014- 5-21 all GtkFrame: make sure that the label doesn't use
                underscore as the widget can not get focus

  89 2014- 522 Guided input: have a transaction when writing the new
               entries so that we can rollback in case of an error

  96 2014- 5-22 entry_models: check that journal always exist as it
                may be deleted at any time while it is empty -
                so reclass the entry models on journal-changed signal

 100 2014- 5-24 add a ofo_sgbd_query_1_1 method which takes a query and
                returns the first column of the first row as an integer
                applications are: <class>_get_back_id 
                                  <class>_count_for_devise

 101 2014- 5-24 when updating the currency of an account, the 'delete'
                button of the 'currencies' page should be updated
     2014- 6-12 ofaDevisesSet should be connected to ofa_signal_updated
                _object...

 107 2014- 5-24 have a message when current exercice changes
                so that e.g. the journals set may adapt its display

 114 2014- 5-26 dispose_has_run should be a protected data of the
                ofaMainPage base class

 126 2014- 5-28 have several demo dossiers

 129 2014- 5-28 Account: archive balances after closing in ACCOUNT_EXE
                table details

 130 2014- 5-28 do not delete an account which has an account_exe archive
                detail record, but set a 'deleted' flag

 146 2014- 5-31 ImportAssistant::do_init_p3_confirm: remove the mnemonic
                ('_') from the GtktoggleButton label when displaying it

 147 2014- 6- 2 ImportAssistant: keep the last folder and reselect it

 148 2014- 6- 2 ImportAssistant: selecting a folder shouldn't make the
                page complete

 149 2014- 6- 2 ImportAssistant: double-clicking a file (or activating 
                the current selection) should advance to the next page

 151 2014- 6- 2 ofaImport::on_apply: to be written

 152 2014- 6- 3 import qif files

 153 2014- 6- 3 import ofx/ofc files

 155 2014- 6- 3 GuidedInput: diff should be red

 156 2014- 6- 3 when selecting an account, do not allow root (or yes ?)

 158 2014- 6- 4 do a coherency check (sgbd constraints, account and
                journal balances, etc.)

 161 2014- 6- 5 Reconciliation: display the bank account balance if
                present

 162 2014- 6- 5 Reconciliation: remove/add a proposition

 163 2014- 6- 5 move the table definition from ofo-dossier to the
                corresponding classes

 164 2014- 6- 5 ExportAssistant: improve the entering of the output file

 165 2014- 6- 5 ExportAssistant: overwrite confirmation doesn't work 

 167 2014- 6- 5 ExportAssistant: pre-positionning a default uri as
                output filename doesn't work

 174 2014- 6- 6 ExportAssistant: change character set to ISO-8859-15
     2014- 6- 7 the exported character set should be a choice of the 
                user (default is UTF-8)

 176 2014- 6- 6 ImportAssistant: let the user select the encoding
                character set of the imported file, so that we are
                able to convert to UTF-8

 177 2014- 6- 9 there is no sens to manage a GtkTreeView in ofaMainPage

 179 2014- 6- 9 ofaModelsSet: manage delete journal (reclass in 
                'Unclassed')

 182 2014- 6-10 configure at the dossier level the default import journal 
                when we are importing entries
                for now, this is harcoded with 'IMPORT' mnemo
                Note that the journal should be configurable: it is ok
                to import e.g. amortissements entries

 183 2014- 6-10 consistency check: check that we do not have entries on 
                unexistant account (this is the case on EBP export which
                 has kept entries on closed accounts

 184 2014- 6-10 use the count of decimal digits of the currency when 
                displaying all amounts

 186 2014- 6-10 check that the IMPORT journal exists before trying to
                import the entries
     2014- 6-11 Is it really mandatory as the imported entries may do
                not use this default import journal at all ?

 187 2014- 6-10 TauxProperties - Validities page: should be sorted by
                end date desc (most recent first)
     2014- 6-13 no: this should be left sorted as the user entered the
                data - so let him reorder the lines

 191 2014- 6-11 Note that a multi-currency journal is not balanced per
                currency, and so its global balance cannot be checked
     2014- 6-18 not exactly: a multi-currency journal may be balanced
                per currency depending of the way the operations are
                entered (and this way should maybe be forced)

 194 2014- 6-11 ofo_journal_get_cloture() should be replaced with
                ofo_journal_get_last_closing()

 195 2014- 6-11 optimize the usage of SELECT COUNT(*) FROM 
                OFA_T_ECRITURES WHERE ECR_JOU_MNEMO=%s query (called 4
                 times on a journal selection in journal_treeview from
                 journals_set)

 212 2014- 6-13 when importing, accept decimal comma as well as decimal
                dot (and this should be a configuration option of the
                assistant, as well as the character set)

 213 2014- 6-13 recurrente entries
     2014- 6-16 to be built as a plugin

 215 2014- 6-13 assets management
     2014- 6-16 to be built as a plugin

 216 2014- 6-13 exercice closing
     2014-10- 6 keep the account balances at the end of the exercice N
                and at the beginning of exercice N+1

 217 2014- 6-13 tableau de trésorerie
     2014-10- 6 this may require the balance be printed
     2014-10- 6 this should be implemented as a plugin

 219 2014- 6-15 one should take care of not increasing the entry number
                until going back to zero during a same exercice (but
                INT_MAX is a very big number)
     2014- 6-16 maybe by prefixing the entry number with the exercice id
                thus having a full entry identifier as '1-1234'
     2014- 6-16 another way may be to just ignore the issue...

 220 2014- 6-16 GuidedInput-Comment: replace the insensitive entry with
                a normal label + move it to the right in order to be
                aligned with account entry

 224 2014- 6-16 DossierProperties: add a tab for the archived exercices

 229 2014- 6-16 Entry model: duplicate a line

 234 2014- 6-17 the ofaMainPage derived-classes should be named
                ofaPageXxxx (or maybe better ofaXxxxPage)
     2014- 6-20 src/ui/ofa-accounts-chart.h
                src/ui/ofa-bat-set.h

 252 2014- 6-23 make the ofoBase objects members of a dynamic loadable
                library (not a dynamically loadabled plugin) of same
                version than sgbd (i.e. 1 as for now)

 253 2014- 6-24 editing rough entries: have a 'select' button besides 
                of the account number when editing an entry

 254 2014- 6-24 editing rough entries: have a 'select' button besides
                of the journal mnemo when editing an entry

 255 2014- 6-23 editing rough entries: add a button to revert the 
                modifications
 
 256 2014- 6-23 editing rough entries: add an icon to advertise that 
                the row has been modified

 259 2014- 6-23 editing rough entries: copy/paste a line

 260 2014- 6-24 editing rough entries: make the columns sortable

 262 2014- 6-27 make g_date_set_parse locale independant (especially
                when parsing from sql)
     2014- 6-27 this seems good, but treeview cells are not connected
                to my_date, and this interprets the date along the
                locale

 264 2014- 6-27 review MySQL data types against C data types

 265 2014- 6-27 review ofa_t_ecritures index: should be just ecr_number
                and check that ecr_number is an unsigned long
                http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/integer-types.html
                http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/C_Programming/C_Reference/limits.h
                describe the limits.
                Has to choose between
                - Mysql unsigned int 4 294 967 295
                  C UINT_MAX        +4,294,967,295
                - Mysql unsigned bigint 18 446 744 073 709 551 615
                  but BIGINT in a specific MySQL extension
                  C ULONG_MAX          +18,446,744,073,709,551,615
                  but this value of ULONG_MAX is only available in
                  64 bits compilers 

 269 2014- 6-27 lettrage des comptes de tiers

 271 2014- 6-27 ViewEntries: set a default effect date with the ope date

 272 2014- 6-27 Have a myDate class or family of functions and take an
                inventory of use (single case vs. couple case - e.g.
                dope/deff, dfrom/dto, etc.)
     2014- 6-28 svn #3754: introduce myDate class 

 273 2014- 6-29 ofa.css: hack ofaTabLabel/GtkGrid/GtkButton/GtkImage 
                styles

 281 2014- 7-14 move import to myAssistant

 282 2014- 7-14 move export to myAssistant

 296 2014- 7-20 creating a new dossier from an existing database needs
                to insert the new admin user from root account (else
                the new user will not be able to connect for updating
                the model)

 303 2014- 8-15 dropping the administrative accounts when deleting a
                dossier is not possible without first checking that
                none of the candidate admin accounts are used in
                any of the databases of the DB server
                -> so the dossier manager should take care of that

 310 2014- 9-15 locale user preferences:
                for amounts, whether to allow the comma as decimal point
                when entering
                for dates, entry as d/m/yyyy ?

 311 2014- 9-21 editing CA12 VAT declaration

 312 2014- 9-22 myEditableAmount: should limit the count of decimals

 313 2014- 9-22 myEditableAmount: should have a format string to
                display a 'decoration' when rendering (e.g. a unit, or
                a standard prefix, or a display format)

 314 2014- 9-26 have a preference to use millenary shortcut
                (i.e. entering '14' gives '2014')

 317 2014-10- 5 view_entries: let the user select an operation template

 318 2014-10- 6 print the balance for a periode
