   8 2014- 5- 2 ofa_application_on_about: to be written

  21 2014- 5- 6 DossierNew: let the user be able to choose to
                create a new database (if the data provider allows it)
                or to use an existing one
     2014- 7-14 when using an existing database, have an option to
                reinitialize it, or to use it as is

  41 2014- 5-12 ofaMainWindow: set menu tooltips

  43 2014- 5-12 ofaMainWindow left pane: should display a big icon and
                a label instead of only a text

  49 2014- 5-15 All properties: monitor "notes" size so
                that we stop the entering at 512 chars

  85 2014- 5-21 Color the frame of the invalid GtkEntry
                + set data "ofa-data-entry-valid"
                + my_utils_entry_is_valid
                + my_utils_entry_set_valid
     2014- 5-22 see also todo #20

  89 2014- 522 Guided input: have a transaction when writing the new
               entries so that we can rollback in case of an error

 126 2014- 5-28 have several demo dossiers

 149 2014- 6- 2 ImportAssistant: double-clicking a file (or activating 
                the current selection) should advance to the next page
     2015- 1-22 this suppose to be able to simulate the click on the
                'Continue' button, but unfortunately GtkAssistant is 
                not a GtkDialog, so do not known how to do ?

 152 2014- 6- 3 import qif files

 153 2014- 6- 3 import ofx/ofc files

 161 2014- 6- 5 Reconciliation: display the bank account balance if
                present

 187 2014- 6-10 TauxProperties - Validities page: should be sorted by
                end date desc (most recent first)
     2014- 6-13 no: this should be left sorted as the user entered the
                data - so let him reorder the lines

 195 2014- 6-11 optimize the usage of SELECT COUNT(*) FROM 
                OFA_T_ECRITURES WHERE ECR_JOU_MNEMO=%s query (called 4
                 times on a journal selection in journal_treeview from
                 journals_set)

 213 2014- 6-13 recurrente entries
     2014- 6-16 to be built as a plugin

 215 2014- 6-13 assets management
     2014- 6-16 to be built as a plugin

 217 2014- 6-13 tableau de trésorerie
     2014-10- 6 this may require the balance be printed
     2014-10- 6 this should be implemented as a plugin

 252 2014- 6-23 make the ofoBase objects members of a dynamic loadable
                library (not a dynamically loadabled plugin) of same
                version than sgbd (i.e. 1 as for now)

 253 2014- 6-24 editing rough entries: have a 'select' button besides 
                of the account number when editing an entry

 254 2014- 6-24 editing rough entries: have a 'select' button besides
                of the ledger mnemo when editing an entry

 255 2014- 6-23 editing rough entries: add a button to revert the 
                modifications
 
 256 2014- 6-23 editing rough entries: add an icon to advertise that 
                the row has been modified
     2015- 2- 5 the entry is saved as soon as the edition finishes
                so there would be an added value if and only if we
                would have a modification history and would be capable
                of going back...

 259 2014- 6-23 editing rough entries: copy/paste a line

 273 2014- 6-29 ofa.css: hack ofaTabLabel/GtkGrid/GtkButton/GtkImage 
                styles

 296 2014- 7-20 creating a new dossier from an existing database needs
                to insert the new admin user from root account (else
                the new user will not be able to connect for updating
                the model)
     2015- 1-22 this is removed from now: only able to create a new
                database when restoring an exercice

 303 2014- 8-15 dropping the administrative accounts when deleting a
                dossier is not possible without first checking that
                none of the candidate admin accounts are used in
                any of the databases of the DB server
                -> so the dossier manager should take care of that

 311 2014- 9-21 editing CA12 VAT declaration

 312 2014- 9-22 myEditableAmount: should limit the count of decimals

 313 2014- 9-22 myEditableAmount: should have a format string to
                display a 'decoration' when rendering (e.g. a unit, or
                a standard prefix, or a display format)

 314 2014- 9-26 have a preference to use millenary shortcut
                (i.e. entering '14' gives '2014')

 325 2014-10-12 DossierManage Properties: to be written

 333 2014-10-18 ViewEntries, Reconciliation: two main pages which display
                a GtkTreeView with debit/credit amount columns:
                homogeneize the display (frame), define a footer bar,
                updating the right decalage as far as columns are 
                displayed

 334 2014-10-18 homogeneize styles:
                e.g. displaying validated entries in ofaViewEntries or
                validated balances if AccountProperties should have the
                same font/background
                + may be useful to use styles ?

 335 2014-10-18 some columns are displayed in several pages/dialogs,
                and should have the same display properties (e.g.
                piece reference, label, debit/credit, etc.) -> the 
                treeview setup should be factorized

 336 2014-10-18 all treeview columns in main pages should be resizeable
                (autoresize on double click is automatically handled)
                and the current width should be kept in settings
     2015- 1-22 no GtkTreeViewColumn primitive for setting a width ??

 429 2014-11-11 implement print preview inside of Openbook

 442 2014-11-13 AccountsBook: add a notes indicator
     2014-12-19 started with svn #4348
                bug left: no background of backgrounded rows...

 445 2014-11-13 my_date: do not accept two successive '/'
     2014-11-23 done - svn #4145
     2015- 1- 8 opened back as doesn't work

 461 2014-11-24 ExportAssistant: implement 'on_new_profile'

 462 2014-11-26 move ofoBat/ofoBatLine to ofaBoxed
     2015- 1- 5 really only required when ofoBat/ofoBatLine will implement
                the ofaIExportable interface - so it is not urgent

 463 2014-11-26 move ofoCurrency to ofaBoxed
     2015- 1- 5 really only required when ofoCurrency will implement the
                ofaIExportable interface *and* if exports any amounts -
                so it is not urgent
     2015- 1- 8 nonetheless required to correctly implement field sep

 464 2014-11-26 move ofoDossier to ofaBoxed
     2015- 1- 5 really only required when ofoDossier will implement the
                ofaIExportable interface *and* if exports any amounts -
                so it is not urgent
     2015- 1- 8 nonetheless required to correctly implement field sep

 466 2014-11-26 move ofoOpeTemplate to ofaBoxed
     2015- 1- 5 really only required when ofoDossier will implement the
                ofaIExportable interface *and* if exports any amounts -
                so it is not urgent
     2015- 1- 8 nonetheless required to correctly implement field sep
     2015- 1-17 field sep is currently (and rightly) taken into account
                by ImportAssistant 

 469 2014-11-28 ExportSettings: the field separator should be free 
                (but not empty nor space) instead of having to select
                among predefined values

 470 2014-11-28 when entering a new database name, only accepts
                [A..Z,a..z,0..9,_] characters

 472 2014-11-29 set dialogs readonly if not current exercice
     2015- 2- 5 done for properties

 494 2014-12- 4 ExeClosing: have a dossier option to have only one  
                centralisation entry when balancing the accounts, or
                have one entry per account
     2014-12- 7 maybe in a next version...

 512 2014-12- 9 have an error message in all dialog box to say why it
                is not validable

 513 2014-12- 9 whether balancing accounts are settleable or 
                reconciliable (and shouldn't) has to be checked when 
                setting these accounts for balance

 519 2014-12-11 ExportAssistant: the list of exportables should be
                dynamically computed from the list of classes which
                implement the ofaIExportable interface

 520 2014-12-11 ImportAssistant: the list of importables should be
                dynamically computed from the list of classes which
                implement the ofaIImportable interface

 525 2014-12-13 when importing entries: review the code to be faster
                import accounts: 0.02286 s/row - 0.02316 s/row (127 rows)
                import ledgers:  0.02982 s/row (9 rows)
                import entries:  0.13268 s/row (2431 rows)
                import entries:  0.13237 s/row (1985 rows)
     2015- 1- 9 problem is the same when closing ledgers
     2015- 1-10 idem when validating entries:
                count=484: average is 0.09846 s

 553 2015- 1- 6 deleting a dossier only removes its references from
                settings - so DossierDelete and DossierDeletePrefs
                become useless (see also #522)

 559 2015- 1- 8 have a macro language to automate dossier creation,
                import of files

 562 2015- 1- 8 Add misc menu option to see the loaded stores, and
                reset them

 567 2015- 1- 9 have an EntryStore ?
     2015- 1-18 - ofaViewEntries add its own columns to its store
                - ofaReconciliation is a tree store with bat lines
                so the usefulness has yet to be proved...

 572 2015- 1-10 refactor: get rid of amounts (not rates), replacing 
                them with integers ?
     2015- 2-16 ofsCurrency makes use of a work-around when checking
                the accounts/entries/ledgers balances
     2015- 3-11 or move the currency to an arbitrary unit per account,
                the currency being only a sort of unit (but may also
                be a day count, etc.) 

 584 2015- 1-12 ofo_insert_entry: should also insert reconciliation and
                settlement data groups if they are set in the object
                (would prevent two updates when closing the exercice)

 599 2015- 1-22 GtkFileChooser in an assistant: unable to select again
                the previously selected file when coming back from an
                other page

 601 2015- 1-24 ExerciceClose: reset BAT files and lines from the new
                database

 607 2015- 1-29 MainWindow on_dossier_open: homogeneize dossier_open and
                dossier_login in order to mutualize some code if possible
                common behavior is: do not close current dossier if we
                are not sure that credentials are ok

 621 2015- 2- 2 ope template: have an help dialog which lists the 
                available macro and functions
     2015- 2- 3 doesn't know how to make ofaOpeTemplateHelp non modal
                while keeping to react to user interactions

 628 2015- 2- 3 FATAL: OpeTemplateProperties: segfault when saving

 632 2015- 2- 8 desktop file: use prefix when installing icon elsewhere
                than standard prefix=/usr

 642 2015- 2- 9 implement BAT page, import button
     2015- 2-15 for now, just disable it - svn #4599

 651 2015- 2-15 replace fixed date and amount configurations with user
                preferences (date display format, comma vs. dot)

 652 2015- 2-15 let the user configure colors

 653 2015- 2-17 GuidedInputBin/OpeTemplateProperties dialogs should be
                non-modal (use case: consult rates)

 656 2015- 2-17 OpeTemplate page: have a shortcut on each tab

 668 2015- 2-17 have main notebook pages detachable ? getting so non-
                modal dialogs
     2015- 2-20 this requires to implement DnD on some non-modal windows

 669 2015- 2-17 have a visual way to distinct between dossiers (e.g. a
                color, a logo, etc.)

 677 2015- 2-19 preferences for the dossier should be set in the dbms
                (e.g. order of ope_templates pages)
     2015- 2-20 why ? to save them in backups and be able to restore 
                them 

 678 2015- 2-19 visual bug which seems to come from GTK+: updating a
                list/tree store only update the display when moving the
                mouse over the row (not necessarily the updated cell)
                -> gtk_tree_model_filter_refilter doesn't help

 684 2015- 2-21 MainWindow left pane: these are shortcuts which should
                be choosable by the user among the defined features

 695 2015- 3- 4 all printings should be first viewable in Openbook
                (to be printed only after user visual validation)

 701 2015- 3- 8 be able to open a current dossier as read-only
                (use case: when user wants to make sure he will not
                modify it inadvertently)

 705 2015- 3- 8 have an interface to add an item to the menubar
                (use case: plugins)

 706 2015- 3- 9 be able to configure some user shortcuts (in particular,
                it would be easier that row-activate on templates page
                opens the guided input rather that the properties)

 707 2015- 3- 9 it would be easier to be directly in overwrite mode
                (and to better manage it) when entering a date: this
                would prevent the user to have to first select the digits
                to be changed

 708 2015- 3- 9 when selecting an account for reconciliation (resp.
                settlement), display in gray those who are not 
                reconciliable (resp. settleable), and refuse the 
                selection

 712 2015- 3-11 accept comma as well as dot as decimal separator
                (is a user pref ?)

 713 2015- 3-11 segfault when deleting the row n°2 from an operation
                template
                GLib-GObject-WARNING **: invalid cast from 'GtkLabel' to 'GtkEntry'
                in remove_row (row=<optimized out>, self=<optimized out>) at ../../../src/ui/ofa-ope-template-properties.c:807
                in on_button_clicked (button=<optimized out>, self=0x74c510) at ../../../src/ui/ofa-ope-template-properties.c:775

 714 2015- 3-11 associate an account with a piece ref (e.g. ESP -> 531)

 715 2015- 3-11 ViewEntries: display balance in orange if not balanced

 716 2015- 3-11 ViewEntries: doesn't display '0,00'

 717 2015- 3-11 AccountsChart: doesn't display '0,00' (but at least one)

 718 2015- 3-12 Reconciliation: wrong propositions

                entered (and this way should maybe be forced)
     2014-11- 5 Having a multi-currencies operation involves:
                - defining operation with multi currencies
                - have shadow accounts in both currencies
                - entering balanced entries in both currencies.

     2014- 6-27 this seems good, but treeview cells are not connected

 687 2015- 3- 2 0.34: segfault: when reconciliating with a manual date
                (but reconciliation has been taken into account)
                file my-date.c: line 100 (my_date_compare): should not be reached

 688 2015- 3- 3 regression in 0.34: a newly bat files appear twice, 
                while it appears again only once after program re-run
     2015- 3- 6 closed as unable to reproduce
     2015- 3- 7 this happened only on the first imported BAT
                fixed - git #5c4ecec

 689 2015- 3- 4 new: be able to point out bat lines corresponding to
                already reconciliated entries (use case: importing a
                bat file for completeness after having reconciliated
                manually the entries)
     2015- 3- 8 the imported BAT lines are rightly inserted under the
                corresponding entry, though are displayed in italic
                as not associated to a reconciliated entry
                -> have an Accept button to individually set a bat line
                -> have a check button to make the bat file all 
                   reconciliated
     2015- 3- 8 done - git #ca9a60e

 690 2015- 3- 4 bat_lines: upd_timestamp is not displayed
     2015- 3- 6 done - git #b7459c9

 691 2015- 3- 4 Reconciliation: when loading a bat file, a proposition
                is made even if the entry is already reconciliated, the
                value date from bat line visually overriding the 
                reconciliation date already set in the entry (no update
                in sgbd)
     2015- 3- 6 closed as non reproducible

 692 2015- 3- 4 it may happen that the bat line is before the entry to
                be reconciliated and thus the proposition is not made;
                let the user force the appariement
     2015- 3- 7 closed as non reproducible

     2015- 3- 6 done - git #617d1c8

 694 2015- 3- 4 It would definitively be useful to be able to recompute 
                the solde of the account at the end of the period when 
                editing a balance
     2015- 3- 7 done with AccountsBalance - git #81264e2

 696 2015- 3- 4 when printing from an account to an account, the

 698 2015- 3- 4 general book is wrong as soon as there are entries 
                before the RAN
     2015- 3- 6 no, but we are computing the solde of displayed entries
                instead of the solde of the account (which is not the
                purpose of the GeneralBooks print)
     2015- 3- 6 done - git #257ef3b

     2015- 3-10 done - git #455f66c

 710 2015- 3-10 as Github directly provides link to download a tarball,
                it will easier for users to directly provides auto-built
                files (as configure, Makefile.in and so on) - so add
                them to git (remove the ignore)
     2015- 3-10 done - git #0a0c523

 711 2015- 3-10 reconciliation: doesn't print 0,00 amounts
