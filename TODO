  61 2014- 5-19 manage dataserver locale as a user preference (format

                so reclass the entry models on journal-changed signal

 101 2014- 5-24 when updating the currency of an account, the 'delete'
                button of the 'currencies' page should be updated
     2014- 6-12 ofaDevisesSet should be connected to ofa_signal_updated
                _object...

 107 2014- 5-24 have a message when current exercice changes
                so that e.g. the journals set may adapt its display

 126 2014- 5-28 have several demo dossiers

 129 2014- 5-28 Account: archive balances after closing in ACCOUNT_EXE
                table details

 130 2014- 5-28 do not delete an account which has an account_exe archive
                detail record, but set a 'deleted' flag

 149 2014- 6- 2 ImportAssistant: double-clicking a file (or activating 
                the current selection) should advance to the next page

                'Unclassed')

 182 2014- 6-10 configure at the dossier level the default import journal 
                when we are importing entries
                for now, this is harcoded with 'IMPORT' mnemo
                Note that the journal should be configurable: it is ok
                to import e.g. amortissements entries

 183 2014- 6-10 consistency check: check that we do not have entries on 
                unexistant account (this is the case on EBP export which
                 has kept entries on closed accounts

 186 2014- 6-10 check that the IMPORT journal exists before trying to
                import the entries
     2014- 6-11 Is it really mandatory as the imported entries may do
                not use this default import journal at all ?

 187 2014- 6-10 TauxProperties - Validities page: should be sorted by
                end date desc (most recent first)
     2014- 6-13 no: this should be left sorted as the user entered the
                data - so let him reorder the lines

 195 2014- 6-11 optimize the usage of SELECT COUNT(*) FROM 
                OFA_T_ECRITURES WHERE ECR_JOU_MNEMO=%s query (called 4
                 times on a journal selection in journal_treeview from
                 journals_set)

 252 2014- 6-23 make the ofoBase objects members of a dynamic loadable
                library (not a dynamically loadabled plugin) of same
                version than sgbd (i.e. 1 as for now)

 253 2014- 6-24 editing rough entries: have a 'select' button besides 
                of the account number when editing an entry

 254 2014- 6-24 editing rough entries: have a 'select' button besides
                of the journal mnemo when editing an entry

                styles

 296 2014- 7-20 creating a new dossier from an existing database needs
                to insert the new admin user from root account (else
                the new user will not be able to connect for updating
                the model)

 303 2014- 8-15 dropping the administrative accounts when deleting a
                dossier is not possible without first checking that
                none of the candidate admin accounts are used in
                any of the databases of the DB server
                -> so the dossier manager should take care of that

 311 2014- 9-21 editing CA12 VAT declaration

 312 2014- 9-22 myEditableAmount: should limit the count of decimals

 313 2014- 9-22 myEditableAmount: should have a format string to
                display a 'decoration' when rendering (e.g. a unit, or
                a standard prefix, or a display format)

 314 2014- 9-26 have a preference to use millenary shortcut
                (i.e. entering '14' gives '2014')

 317 2014-10- 5 view_entries: let the user select an operation template

 319 2014-10- 7 review ofo_entry_get_csv()

 321 2014-10- 8 Ledger properties balance: should have '€' sign like
                account properties balance

 323 2014-10- 9 review the setters as most probably only properties
                setters are useful, while others may be only internally
                used
                command is:
                grep _set_ src/api/ofo-*.h | while read l; do \
                fi="$(echo "$l" | awk -F: '{ print $1 }' | \

 325 2014-10-12 DossierManage Properties: to be written

 326 2014-10-12 when entering a new operation via an operation template,
                let the user enter only dd/mm, then automatically
                computing the year on focus out

 327 2014-10-14 Select account: size and position should be kept 
                distinctly for each usage

 329 2014-10-17 updating an entry in ViewEntries should be repercuted
                to the same entry in Reconciliation

 330 2014-10-17 reconciliating an entry in Reconciliation should update
                the display of corresponding column in ViewEntries

 331 2014-10-17 clearing the display BAT lines in Reconciliation : what
                is it supposed to do ?

 332 2014-10-17 Reconciliation: should not accept Enter to annulate the
                reconciliation on an entry, as it is too easy to make
                an error

 333 2014-10-18 ViewEntries, Reconciliation: two main pages which display
                a GtkTreeView with debit/credit amount columns:
                homogeneize the display (frame), define a footer bar,
                updating the right decalage as far as columns are 
                displayed

 334 2014-10-18 honomgeneize styles:
                e.g. displaying validated entries in ofaViewEntries or
                validated balances if AccountProperties should have the
                same font/background
                + may be useful to use styles ?

 335 2014-10-18 some columns are displayed in several pages/dialogs,
                and should have the same display properties (e.g.
                piece reference, label, debit/credit, etc.) -> the 
                treeview setup should be factorized

 336 2014-10-18 all treeview columns in main pages should be resizeable
                (autoresize on double click is automatically handled)
                and the current width should be kept in settings

 342 2014-10-26 document signals + callbacks should be signals
                - ofaAccountsBook

 419 2014-11- 3 Accept 'Suppr' key for delete (at least in accounts 
                book, but most probably also in other treeviews)

                which have an effect date before the beginning of the 
                exercice (the ledger will stay unbalanced)

 442 2014-11-13 AccountsBook: add a notes indicator

 455 2014-11-14 report colored footer in other pages with balances
                (as view entries)

 467 2014-11-26 move ofoRate to ofaBoxed

 469 2014-11-28 ExportSettings: the field separator should be free 
                (but not empty nor space) instead of having to select
                among predefined values

 470 2014-11-28 when entering a new database name, only accepts
                [A..Z,a..z,0..9,_] characters

 494 2014-12- 4 ExeClosing: have a dossier option to have only one  
                centralisation entry when balancing the accounts, or
                have one entry per account
     2014-12- 7 maybe in a next version...

 497 2014-12- 6 bug: ofoRate exports with a decimal dot, doesn't take 
                into account the settings
     2014-12- 7 have to migrate to ofaBox

 502 2014-12- 6 when entered in the command-line, accept an empty 
                database (and defaults to the current)
     2014-12- 7 idem for account and password (let the user enter them)
                + has to with command-line management and maybe also

 518 2014-12-10 DossierCur: try to make transient vs the main window

 519 2014-12-11 ExportAssistant: the list of exportables should be
                dynamically computed from the list of classes which
                implement the ofaIExportable interface

 520 2014-12-11 ImportAssistant: the list of importables should be

                getting ride of defined callbacks

                per currency depending of the way the operations are
                entered (and this way should maybe be forced)
     2014-11- 5 Having a multi-currencies operation involves:
                - defining operation with multi currencies
                - have shadow accounts in both currencies

 262 2014- 6-27 make g_date_set_parse locale independant (especially

     2014- 6-27 this seems good, but treeview cells are not connected
                to my_date, and this interprets the date along the
                locale
