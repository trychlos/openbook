   8 2014- 5- 2 ofa_application_on_about: to be written

  14 2014- 5- 4 have a preference: assistant cancel on escape
     2014- 5- 5 ofa-dossier-new.c: variable 'pref_quit_on_escape'

                ofa-main-window.c: variable 'pref_confirm_on_altf4'

  20 2014- 5- 5 Assistant Dossier/New: display the asterisks (mandatory)
                in another color (grey ? red ? blue ?)

  21 2014- 5- 6 Assistant DossierNew: let the user be able to choose to
                create a new database (if the data provider allows it)
                or to use an existing one

  23 2014- 5- 8 Add a progress page to DossierNew assistant, displaying
                the executed SQL statements

  31 2014- 5- 8 Undo the actions partially done if Dossier New cannot be
                terminated (act as a commit transaction), so that all is
                left as this was initially if something goes wrong

  35 2014- 5-10 DossierOpen should monitor the configuration, only
                enabling the action when there is at least one defined
                dossier

  36 2014- 5-11 win.close action should only be enabled when a dossier 
                is opened

  37 2014- 5-11 DossierNew: fix the order of the focus on pages p2 and

                successfull)

  39 2014- 5-11 DossierNew: add field needed to complete the

  42 2014- 5-12 ofaMainWindow: set menu items sensitivities

  43 2014- 5-12 ofaMainWindow left pane: should display a big icon and
                a label instead of only a text

  44 2014- 5-13 ofaAccountsChart: set an accelerator for each page of
                the classes book (e.g. Alt+1, etc.); set the label of
                this accel as a tooltip of the notebook's page

  45 2014- 5-13 ofaMainWindow left pane: set the width of the tree

  46 2014- 5-13 chart of accounts: this is a user preference whether
                a double clic enter in 'Update' or in 'Consult entries'

  49 2014- 5-15 All properties: monitor "notes" size so
                that we stop the entering at 512 chars

  50 2014- 5-17 when defining a new model, the default family should be
                the current family in models_set

  51 2014- 5-17 Be able to use an underscore in the label of the model
                families; this underscore should be usable as a shortcut
                when dealing with the models in models set

  52 2014- 5-17 change the title of the pages of the models notebook
                when the label of a journal is changed

  53 2014- 5-17 on pages which embed a notebook, one should reset
                button sensititviy when switching the page
                because the on_selection_changed may not be triggered,
                e.g. if the list is empty

  54 2014- 5-18 remove GtkWindow *parent from ofa_sgbd arguments,
                re-enabling error messages.

  55 2014- 5-18 ofo_dossier_insert: use ofoBase virtual function.

  56 2014- 5-19 have an entry for date

  57 2014- 5-19 have an entry for numbers (montants et taux)

  58 2014- 5-19 allow the treeviewes to be sorted

  59 2014- 5-19 reset all sentences in english
                as the g_date_set_parse uses the current locale, the 
                only way to enter a date as dd/mm/yyyy is to use the
                french locale 

  60 2014- 5-19 manage locale as a user preference (format for entering
                date, amounts and rates)

  61 2014- 5-19 manage dataserver locale as a user preference (format 
                for storing date, amounts and rates) - this is rather
                a configuration information than actually a user pref..

  62 2014- 5-19 review all the rates management:
                there should be a maste record (the rate) and child
                records (the different periods of validity)

  63 2014- 5-19 TauxPropertiesDlg: second column of grid seems to extends,
                but shouldn't. Labels on the third column are correctly 
                left-aligned but shifted on the right 

  64 2014- 5-19 there is no need to store the dataset in the ofaMainPage
                as the TreeModel is enough to store the data

  65 2014- 5-19 Entry model properties: be able to reorder the detail
                lines by drag and drop. 

  66 2014- 5-19 Entry model properties - check_enable_dlg
                check that detail lines are ok (enough and balanced).

  67 2014- 5-19 EntryModel properties: row number is not right aligned
                but should

  68 2014- 5-19 EntryModel properties: display row number as an 
                insensitive (grayed) text

  69 2014- 5-19 EntryModel properties: implement Up/Down

  70 2014- 5-19 EntryModel properties: implement Remove with a user
                confirmation.

  71 2014- 5-19 Get an entry with a model.
