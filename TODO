                (e.g. open-freelance-accounting.org)

   3 2014- 5- 2 ofa.doap: have a download page

   5 2014- 5- 2 ofa.doap: have a mailing list

   7 2014- 5- 2 have a preference to set the application menu on the
                top bar (gnome-shell) or on the main windows

  21 2014- 5- 6 DossierNew: let the user be able to choose to
                create a new database (if the data provider allows it)
                or to use an existing one
     2014- 7-14 when using an existing database, have an option to
                reinitialize it, or to use it as is

  41 2014- 5-12 ofaMainWindow: set menu tooltips

  43 2014- 5-12 ofaMainWindow left pane: should display a big icon and
                a label instead of only a text

  49 2014- 5-15 All properties: monitor "notes" size so
                that we stop the entering at 512 chars
     2014- 6-21 at 4096 chars now...
     2015-10- 6 monitoring works and doesn't allow more than 4095 chars
                but keep emitting a Gtk-Warning

     2014- 5-22 see also (cancelled) todo #20

 126 2014- 5-28 have several demo dossiers

 152 2014- 6- 3 import qif files

 153 2014- 6- 3 import ofx/ofc files

 215 2014- 6-13 assets management
     2014- 6-16 to be built as a plugin

 217 2014- 6-13 tableau de trésorerie
     2014-10- 6 this may require the balance be printed
     2014-10- 6 this should be implemented as a plugin

 253 2014- 6-24 editing rough entries: have a 'select' button besides 
                of the account number when editing an entry

 254 2014- 6-24 editing rough entries: have a 'select' button besides
                of the ledger mnemo when editing an entry

 255 2014- 6-23 editing rough entries: add a button to revert the 
                modifications
 
 256 2014- 6-23 editing rough entries: add an icon to advertise that 
                the row has been modified
     2015- 2- 5 the entry is saved as soon as the edition finishes
                so there would be an added value if and only if we
                would have a modification history and would be capable
                of going back...

 259 2014- 6-23 editing rough entries: copy/paste a line

 273 2014- 6-29 ofa.css: hack ofaTabLabel/GtkGrid/GtkButton/GtkImage 
                styles

 312 2014- 9-22 myEditableAmount: should limit the count of decimals

 313 2014- 9-22 myEditableAmount: should have a format string to
                display a 'decoration' when rendering (e.g. a unit, or
                a standard prefix, or a display format)

 314 2014- 9-26 have a preference to use millenary shortcut
                (i.e. entering '14' gives '2014')

 325 2014-10-12 DossierManage Properties: to be written

 334 2014-10-18 homogeneize styles:
                e.g. displaying validated entries in ofaViewEntries or
                validated balances if AccountProperties should have the
                same font/background
                + may be useful to use styles ?

 442 2014-11-13 AccountsBook: add a notes indicator
     2014-12-19 started with svn #4348
                bug left: no background on highlighted rows...

 445 2014-11-13 my_date: do not accept two successive '/'
     2014-11-23 done - svn #4145
     2015- 1- 8 opened back as doesn't work

 461 2014-11-24 ExportAssistant: implement 'on_new_profile'

 462 2014-11-26 move ofoBat/ofoBatLine to ofaBoxed
     2015- 1- 5 really only required when ofoBat/ofoBatLine will implement
                the ofaIExportable interface - so it is not urgent

 513 2014-12- 9 whether balancing accounts are settleable or 
                reconciliable (and shouldn't) has to be checked when 
                setting these accounts for balance

 525 2014-12-13 when importing entries: review the code to be faster
                import accounts: 0.02286 s/row - 0.02316 s/row (127 rows)
                import ledgers:  0.02982 s/row (9 rows)
                import entries:  0.13268 s/row (2431 rows)
                import entries:  0.13237 s/row (1985 rows)
     2015- 1- 9 problem is the same when closing ledgers
     2015- 1-10 idem when validating entries:
                count=484: average is 0.09846 s

 553 2015- 1- 6 deleting a dossier only removes its references from
                settings - so DossierDelete and DossierDeletePrefs
                become useless (see also #522)

 559 2015- 1- 8 have a macro language to automate dossier creation,
                import of files
     2016- 1-27 other use case: automatically print the reports on
                period closing

 584 2015- 1-12 ofo_insert_entry: should also insert reconciliation and
                settlement data groups if they are set in the object
                (would prevent two updates when closing the exercice)

 599 2015- 1-22 GtkFileChooser in an assistant: unable to select again
                the previously selected file when coming back from an
                other page

 601 2015- 1-24 ExerciceClose: reset BAT files and lines from the new
                database
     2016- 4-20 see also #886.
     2016-10-12 + purge reconciliation groups (wich was actually the #886)

 632 2015- 2- 8 desktop file: use prefix when installing icon elsewhere
                than standard prefix=/usr
     2016- 1-25 icon is installed in $(datadir)

 652 2015- 2-15 let the user configure colors
     2015- 3-13 (branch colors) doesn't know how to go back from custom 
                in GtkColorChooserWidget (this is bad)
                + have to decide whether dossier color is a user pref
                or a dossier pref (for all users of this dossier)

 656 2015- 2-17 OpeTemplate page: have a shortcut on each tab

 684 2015- 2-21 MainWindow left pane: these are shortcuts which should
                be choosable by the user among the defined features

 706 2015- 3- 9 be able to configure some user shortcuts (in particular,
                it would be easier that row-activate on templates page
                opens the guided input rather that the properties)

 733 2015- 3-15 FEAT be able to search for an entry

 758 2015- 3-21 FEAT warns when deleting a settled or reconciliated
                     entry +unsettle/unreconciliate

 761 2015- 3-22 DISP in the warning displayed when restoring to a
                     database, display the target database in bold (or
                     red)

 783 2015- 4- 3 FEAT have a summary of unsettle/unreconciliated entries
                     which will be reported after exercice closing
     2016- 4-28 use case: when preparing the exercice closing, have a
                direct view of unsettled entries on settleable accounts
                + idem for unreconciliated on reconciliable

 790 2015- 4- 6 DISP GuidedInputEx: replace the treeview by a revealer ?

 792 2015- 4- 6 FEAT have a comment in the backup

 796 2015- 4-13 FEAT IRenderable: have a second level of grouping
                     (subgroup) use case: when printing accounts book,
                     have a subtotal per class

 799 2015- 4-13 DISP AccountsBook account top and bottom reports:
                     - add a label [bottom report] or [top report] ?
                     - in italic ?
                     - added to the account label or rigt-aligned before the
                       debit ?

 808 2015- 4-17 DISP when rendering, automatically computes the width of 
                     standard field as date or amount
     2015- 4-20      depending of the different headers and footers of
                     the current print, this should involve selecting the
                     ad-hoc font before computing the size

 809 2015- 4-17 FEAT when computing the ODs, do not generate an OD for
                     "forfait kilométrique BNC" when option is "FR"

 810 2015- 4-17 FEAT when computing the ODs, the "Frais réels du
                     véhicule" should distinguish HT and TVA (but, yes,
                     compute on TTC)

 812 2015- 4-17 FEAT libellé des écritures d'amortissement: ajouter le
                     numéro d'annuité et le nb total (#7 - 3/4)

 821 2015- 4-27 ARCH check that concenating strings doesn't override the
                     limit (as the MySQL truncation may make the string
                     invalid utf-8) and take care to truncate to a valid
                     utf-8

 822 2015- 4-27 FEAT Review "solde at 01/01": these are not accounts
                     balances after entries from 01/01, but opening
                     exercice after carried forward entries *only*

                     assistants
                     - RestoreAssistant: dossier treeview after created
                       a new dossier
                     - administrative credentials

 909 2015-11-26 ARCH SIGNAL_DOSSIER_EXE_DATE_CHANGED: change to same
                     signal (exe_dates_changed) sent on main window so
                     that it may automatically update window title

 910 2015-11-30 FEAT let the user configure the main title components as
                     a preference

 920 2015-12-10 FEAT review RestoreAssistant
                     + let restore on a selected exercice rather than on
                     the current one
     2016- 6- 3 have a checkbutton restoring as an archive or as the
                current exercice

 938 2015-12-21 ARCH distinguish a core api with core objects (eg. for
                     command-line only tools) and a ui api which contains
                     some base classes and interfaces which would be useful
                     for plugins => implies to have a core lib and a ui lib
     2015-12-27      have to choose between api/ui or api-ui styles

                     -def includes are always used in headers (and only)

 966 2016- 1-10 FEAT tva/ofoTVARecord: make it printable

                     own GtkBin, in order to take its own parameters
                     use case: when importing entries, should be able to
                     choose whether to import reconciliations/settlements
                     or no, to import deleted entries

                     wrong

1012 2016- 2-25 FEAT OpeTemplate: when a row is moved up or down, then

     2016- 5- 2 use case: maintain the misc-collector UI up to date

1102 2016- 5- 1 my_utils_widget_style_xx: is not consistent with a CSS

1110 2016- 5- 5 BUG DnD: when drag and drop page - see TODO_1110/trace
                gdk_window_move_resize_internal: assertion 'GDK_IS_WINDOW (window)' failed

1147 2016- 6- 8 UserPref: whether to take advantage of tab reordering
                or of detachable pages in the main book as the two are
                mutually exclusive

1149 2016- 6- 8 FEAT: print the accounts archived balances for a given date
                SELECT a.ACC_NUMBER,a.ACC_LABEL,b.ACC_ARC_DEBIT-b.ACC_ARC_CREDIT FROM OFA_T_ACCOUNTS a,OFA_T_ACCOUNTS_ARC b WHERE a.ACC_NUMBER LIKE '5%' AND b.ACC_ARC_DATE='2016-01-31' AND a.ACC_NUMBER=b.ACC_NUMBER;

1150 2016- 6-20 BUG: LedgersBook: template code should be ellipsized
                + review all prints for identifiers which have been

                (may be useful when computing solde of an account)

1231 2016-10-11 Feature question: should we reset the last closed date
                of the ledgers when closing an exercice ?
                For now, they are not reset. On the new exercice, ledgers
                are displayed with a last closed date in the previous
                exercice (weird ?)

1235 2016-10-12 begining of the exercice cannot be modified anymore after
                the first exercice operation

1236 2016-10-13 move user and dossier settings to dbms
     2016-11-13 dossier settings are:

     2016-11-17 path is nonetheless kept from last function call

                => have recovery assistant

1261 2016-11-17 Have a backup option to save all available periods
                + have an option to save this choice (do not automatically save)

1262 2016-11-17 pass settings_prefix as a constructor argument (or know why)

1263 2016-11-19 store documents
                + attach documents via an interface to:
                - BAT: the original imported document from the bank,
                - operations: the bill, or the purchase trace
                - entries: idem operation,
                - accounts: all documents for this account

1265 2016-11-28 myISettings: simplify the interface
     2016-12- 8 we roughly only need read strlist and write str 

1267 2016-11-29 obsolete ofa_dossier_collection_set_meta_from_editor()

                moving to mysql

1276 2016-12-10 review the way the exercices are written in dossier settings
                so that this may be managed by the application instead of
                by the dbms plugin

1279 2016-12-13 igetter_get_theme_manager() -> igetter_get_page_manager()

1280 2016-12-13 recurrent operations open the page with all rows selected

                the accounts/entries/ledgers balances
     2015- 3-11 or move the currency to an arbitrary unit per account,
                the currency being only a sort of unit (but may also

 707 2015- 3- 9 it would be easier to be directly in overwrite mode
                (and to better manage it) when entering a date: this

                - implement actions in the page

1186 2016- 8-31 ofaListStore: should it be obsoleted because useless ?
                Rationale is that list stores are only a particular case
                of tree stores...
     2016- 9-14 Yes, indeed, this is right. Nonetheless, the Gtk+ documentation
                prevents against the use of the GtkTreeStore when only a
                GtkListStore would be enough, as the former adds some code
                overhead...

     2016- 9-15 these already were the same fonts, probably appearing smaller

                in a read-only way ? -> no confidentiality
                -> cancelled

1264 2016-11-24 PortfolioCollection: rename to DossierCollection
                + this is this class which gives the list of dossiers
     2016-12-10 done

1266 2016-11-28 openbook: have two objects derived from mySettings class
     2016-12- 6 + registering them in ofaHub
     2016-12-13 done for dossier settings
     2016-12-16 done for user settings, decommissionning ofaSettings class

1268 2016-11-29 ofaDossierMeta class obsoletes ofaIDBMeta interface
                and ofaMysqlMeta class.
     2016-12- 8 there is no real added value to have a class object different
                as ofaIDBConnect has anyway to know the main class to be able
                to see if a given dossier if opened
                -> cancelled

1269 2016-11-29 ofaExerciceMeta class obsoletes ofaIDBPeriod interface
                and ofaMysqlPeriod class
     2016-12- 8 -> cancelled (same as #1268)

1272 2016-12- 6 move initialization from ofa_application_new() to
                application_startup() if possible
     2016-12-12 done

1273 2016-12- 6 move to hub initialization all the stuff which is not
                required by the ui (and not by gtk as Gtk may be required
                by the plugins which not all involve the ui)
     2016-12-12 done

1274 2016-12- 8 rename ofaIDBMeta to ofaIDBDossierMeta
     2016-12-10 done

1275 2016-12- 8 rename ofaIDBPeriod to ofaIDBExerciceMeta
     2016-12-10 done

1277 2016-12-10 rename ofaMySQLMeta to ofaMysqlDossierMeta
     2016-12-11 done

1278 2016-12-10 rename ofaMySQLPeriod to ofaMysqlExerciceMeta
     2016-12-11 done

1288 2016-12-14 ofa_idbmodel_update: have a getter instead of the hub
                (for consistency reasons)
     2016-12-14 done
