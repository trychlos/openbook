  31 2014- 5- 8 Undo the actions partially done if Dossier New cannot be
                terminated (act as a commit transaction), so that all is
                left as this was initially if something goes wrong

  35 2014- 5-10 DossierOpen should monitor the configuration, only
                enabling the action when there is at least one defined

  37 2014- 5-11 DossierNew: fix the order of the focus on pages p2 and

  45 2014- 5-13 ofaMainWindow left pane: set the width of the tree

  46 2014- 5-13 chart of accounts: this is a user preference whether
                a double clic enter in 'Update' or in 'Consult entries'

  49 2014- 5-15 All properties: monitor "notes" size so
                that we stop the entering at 512 chars

  50 2014- 5-17 when defining a new model, the default family should be
                the current family in models_set
     2014- 5-22 Family class is abandonned, but the subject is the same 
                with Journal clas

                button sensititviy when switching the page
                because the on_selection_changed may not be triggered,
                e.g. if the list is empty

  55 2014- 5-18 ofo_dossier_insert: use ofoBase virtual function.

  56 2014- 5-19 have an entry for date

  57 2014- 5-19 have an entry for numbers (montants et taux)

  58 2014- 5-19 allow the treeviewes to be sorted

                date, amounts and rates)

  61 2014- 5-19 manage dataserver locale as a user preference (format 
                for storing date, amounts and rates) - this is rather
                a configuration information than actually a user pref..

  62 2014- 5-19 review all the rates management:
                there should be a master record (the rate) and child
                records (the different periods of validity)

  63 2014- 5-19 TauxPropertiesDlg: second column of grid seems to extends,
                but shouldn't. Labels on the third column are correctly 
                left-aligned but shifted on the right 

  64 2014- 5-19 there is no need to store the dataset in the ofaMainPage
                as the TreeModel is enough to store the data

                lines by drag and drop. 

  69 2014- 5-19 EntryModel properties: implement Up/Down

                confirmation.

  74 2014- 5-21 Guided input: when quitting the dialog with Escape
                while the focus is on an Account entry, then the
                account notebook fires, but shouldn't.

  75 2014- 5-21 Optimize AccountNotebook to not recreate it each time
                it is called

  77 2014- 5-21 Guided Input: default effect date is operation date
                or first davailable date

  78 2014- 5-21 Guided Input: check that the effect date is valid

  79 2014- 5-21 replace memcpy with g_memdup when possible

  80 2014- 5-21 my-utils: replace g_strdup_printf with g_date_strftime

  84 2014- 5-21 Port the GuidedInput code model to ModelProperties
                (GtkGrid+GtkEntry instead of GtkTreeView)

  85 2014- 5-21 Color the frame of the invalid GtkEntry
                + set data "ofa-data-entry-valid"
                + my_utils_entry_is_valid
                + my_utils_entry_set_valid
     2014- 5-22 see also Todo #20

  86 2014- 5-21 all GtkFrame: make sure that the label doesn't use
                underscore as the widget can not get focus

  87 2014- 5-22 Guided input: check that the selected account is of
                type detail

  89 2014- 522 Guided input: have a transaction when writing the new
               entries so that we can rollback in case of an error

  91 2014- 5-22 the name of the class names in the accounts chart
                should be configured in a table

  92 2014- 5-22 are we allowed to delete a journal ?
                - if it contains some entries ? -> NO
                - if entry models are defined on it ? -> yes, but
                  entry models have so to be reclassed in "no journal"
                  which made them invalid

  93 2014- 5-22 implement journal_load_set: load the journal_det
                table

  94 2014- 5-22 implement journal_record_entry

  95 2014- 5-22 implement journal_is_empty

  96 2014- 5-22 entry_models: check that journal always exist as it
                may be deleted at any time while it is empty -
                so reclass the entry models on journal-changed signal
