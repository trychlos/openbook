   5 2014- 5- 2 ofa.doap: have a mailing list

   7 2014- 5- 2 have a preference to set the application menu on the
                top bar (gnome-shell) or on the main windows

  21 2014- 5- 6 DossierNew: let the user be able to choose to
                create a new database (if the data provider allows it)
                or to use an existing one
     2014- 7-14 when using an existing database, have an option to
                reinitialize it, or to use it as is

  41 2014- 5-12 ofaMainWindow: set menu tooltips

  43 2014- 5-12 ofaMainWindow left pane: should display a big icon and
                a label instead of only a text

  49 2014- 5-15 All properties: monitor "notes" size so
                that we stop the entering at 512 chars
     2014- 6-21 at 4096 chars now...
     2015-10- 6 monitoring works and doesn't allow more than 4095 chars
                but keep emitting a Gtk-Warning

  85 2014- 5-21 Color the frame of the invalid GtkEntry
                + set data "ofa-data-entry-valid"
                + my_utils_entry_is_valid
                + my_utils_entry_set_valid
     2014- 5-22 see also (cancelled) todo #20

 126 2014- 5-28 have several demo dossiers

 152 2014- 6- 3 import qif files

 153 2014- 6- 3 import ofx/ofc files

 215 2014- 6-13 assets management
     2014- 6-16 to be built as a plugin

 217 2014- 6-13 tableau de trésorerie
     2014-10- 6 this may require the balance be printed
     2014-10- 6 this should be implemented as a plugin

 253 2014- 6-24 editing rough entries: have a 'select' button besides 
                of the account number when editing an entry

 254 2014- 6-24 editing rough entries: have a 'select' button besides

 255 2014- 6-23 editing rough entries: add a button to revert the 
                modifications
 
 256 2014- 6-23 editing rough entries: add an icon to advertise that 
                the row has been modified
     2015- 2- 5 the entry is saved as soon as the edition finishes
                so there would be an added value if and only if we
                would have a modification history and would be capable
                of going back...

 259 2014- 6-23 editing rough entries: copy/paste a line

 273 2014- 6-29 ofa.css: hack ofaTabLabel/GtkGrid/GtkButton/GtkImage 
                styles

 312 2014- 9-22 myEditableAmount: should limit the count of decimals

 313 2014- 9-22 myEditableAmount: should have a format string to
                display a 'decoration' when rendering (e.g. a unit, or
                a standard prefix, or a display format)

 314 2014- 9-26 have a preference to use millenary shortcut
                (i.e. entering '14' gives '2014')

 334 2014-10-18 homogeneize styles:
                e.g. displaying validated entries in ofaViewEntries or
                validated balances if AccountProperties should have the
                same font/background
                + may be useful to use styles ?

 445 2014-11-13 my_date: do not accept two successive '/'
     2014-11-23 done - svn #4145
     2015- 1- 8 opened back as doesn't work

 461 2014-11-24 ExportAssistant: implement 'on_new_profile'

 462 2014-11-26 move ofoBat/ofoBatLine to ofaBoxed
     2015- 1- 5 really only required when ofoBat/ofoBatLine will implement
                the ofaIExportable interface - so it is not urgent

 525 2014-12-13 when importing entries: review the code to be faster
                import accounts: 0.02286 s/row - 0.02316 s/row (127 rows)
                import ledgers:  0.02982 s/row (9 rows)
                import entries:  0.13268 s/row (2431 rows)
                import entries:  0.13237 s/row (1985 rows)
     2015- 1- 9 problem is the same when closing ledgers
     2015- 1-10 idem when validating entries:
                count=484: average is 0.09846 s

 559 2015- 1- 8 have a macro language to automate dossier creation,
                import of files
     2016- 1-27 other use case: automatically print the reports on
                period closing

 584 2015- 1-12 ofo_insert_entry: should also insert reconciliation and
                settlement data groups if they are set in the object
                (would prevent two updates when closing the exercice)

 632 2015- 2- 8 desktop file: use prefix when installing icon elsewhere
                than standard prefix=/usr
     2016- 1-25 icon is installed in $(datadir)

 652 2015- 2-15 let the user configure colors
     2015- 3-13 (branch colors) doesn't know how to go back from custom 
                in GtkColorChooserWidget (this is bad)
                + have to decide whether dossier color is a user pref
                or a dossier pref (for all users of this dossier)

 656 2015- 2-17 OpeTemplate page: have a shortcut on each tab

 684 2015- 2-21 MainWindow left pane: these are shortcuts which should
                be choosable by the user among the defined features

 706 2015- 3- 9 be able to configure some user shortcuts (in particular,
                it would be easier that row-activate on templates page
                opens the guided input rather that the properties)

 796 2015- 4-13 FEAT IRenderable: have a second level of grouping
                     (subgroup) use case: when printing accounts book,
                     have a subtotal per class

 799 2015- 4-13 DISP AccountsBook account top and bottom reports:
                     - add a label [bottom report] or [top report] ?
                     - in italic ?
                     - added to the account label or rigt-aligned before the
                       debit ?

 808 2015- 4-17 DISP when rendering, automatically computes the width of 
                     standard field as date or amount
     2015- 4-20      depending of the different headers and footers of
                     the current print, this should involve selecting the
                     ad-hoc font before computing the size

 809 2015- 4-17 FEAT when computing the ODs, do not generate an OD for
                     "forfait kilométrique BNC" when option is "FR"

 810 2015- 4-17 FEAT when computing the ODs, the "Frais réels du
                     véhicule" should distinguish HT and TVA (but, yes,
                     compute on TTC)

 812 2015- 4-17 FEAT libellé des écritures d'amortissement: ajouter le
                     numéro d'annuité et le nb total (#7 - 3/4)

 821 2015- 4-27 ARCH check that concenating strings doesn't override the
                     limit (as the MySQL truncation may make the string
                     invalid utf-8) and take care to truncate to a valid
                     utf-8

 822 2015- 4-27 FEAT Review "solde at 01/01": these are not accounts
                     balances after entries from 01/01, but opening
                     exercice after carried forward entries *only*

 824 2015- 9-22 PACK use AX_COMPILER_FLAGS

 825 2015- 9-22 PACK use AM_GNU_GETTEXT instead of AM_GLIB_GNU_GETTEXT

 862 2015-10- 7 DISP fix focus order on GtkBin-derived widgets on the
                     assistants
                     - RestoreAssistant: dossier treeview after created
                       a new dossier
                     - administrative credentials

 910 2015-11-30 FEAT let the user configure the main title components as
                     a preference

 938 2015-12-21 ARCH distinguish a core api with core objects (eg. for
                     command-line only tools) and a ui api which contains
                     some base classes and interfaces which would be useful
                     for plugins => implies to have a core lib and a ui lib
     2015-12-27      have to choose between api/ui or api-ui styles

 956 2016- 1- 6 PACK add to make distcheck a script which checks that
                     -def includes are always used in headers (and only)

 966 2016- 1-10 FEAT tva/ofoTVARecord: make it printable
     2016- 6- 3  with a checkbutton for printing all lines including zeroes,
                 or only non-zero lines

 971 2016- 2- 3 FEAT have recently used dossiers
     2016- 3-23 note that this list should go to dossier settings

 983 2016- 2-11 FEAT ImportAssistant: each type should be able to add its
                     own GtkBin, in order to take its own parameters
                     use case: when importing entries, should be able to
                     choose whether to import reconciliations/settlements
                     or no, to import deleted entries
     2016- 3- 1 +accounts: import balances
     201è- 2- 7 it would be more useful to have a preview of the imported
                file, and a mapping page

1003 2016- 2-24 FEAT RenderPage: add navigation+zoom buttons

1012 2016- 2-25 FEAT OpeTemplate: when a row is moved up or down, then
                     the indexes should be updated accordingly

1018 2016- 2-27 BUG  it may happens a BAT file be displayed twice in the
                     BAT page (a restart fixes this)

1075 2016- 4-14 have a message bar
     2016- 4-20 describe a use case

1093 2016- 4-19 CODE should ICollector have its own messaging system
                     on add/remove actions (update/reload cannot be managed
                     here) ?
     2016- 5- 2 use case: maintain the misc-collector UI up to date

1102 2016- 5- 1 my_utils_widget_style_xx: is not consistent with a CSS
                file in the application directory layout

1110 2016- 5- 5 BUG DnD: when drag and drop page - see TODO_1110/trace
                gdk_window_move_resize_internal: assertion 'GDK_IS_WINDOW (window)' failed

1149 2016- 6- 8 FEAT: print the accounts archived balances for a given date
                SELECT a.ACC_NUMBER,a.ACC_LABEL,b.ACC_ARC_DEBIT-b.ACC_ARC_CREDIT FROM OFA_T_ACCOUNTS a,OFA_T_ACCOUNTS_ARC b WHERE a.ACC_NUMBER LIKE '5%' AND b.ACC_ARC_DATE='2016-01-31' AND a.ACC_NUMBER=b.ACC_NUMBER;

1153 2016- 6-22 FEAT: besides of the integrity constraint checks, display
                e.g. operation templates which use such account, and so on

1172 2016- 7-11 Gtk-WARNING **: Allocating size to ofaMainWindow 0x99e400 without calling gtk_widget_get_preferred_width/height(). How does the code know the size to allocate?
                when opening the first page

1192 2016- 9-14 FEAT: export the balance for a period

1194 2016- 9-14 ViewEntries: the effect dates filter frame should expand
                vertically (+ review left and right margins)
     2016-10- 6 margins reviewed.

1196 2016- 9-14 FEAT: all printings: let a plugin draw a dossier-specific
                background

1231 2016-10-11 Feature question: should we reset the last closed date
                of the ledgers when closing an exercice ?
                For now, they are not reset. On the new exercice, ledgers
                are displayed with a last closed date in the previous
                exercice (weird ?)

1235 2016-10-12 begining of the exercice cannot be modified anymore after
                the first exercice operation
     2017- 3-29 unless entries are rightly remediated

1236 2016-10-13 DBMS: move user and dossier settings to dbms
     2016-11-13 dossier settings are:
                $ grep -vE '^#|^\[|^ofa-DBMSProvider|^mysql-db-' ~/.config/openbook/dossier* | cut -d: -f2- | cut -d= -f1 | sort -u
                - LastBackupFolder
                - ofa-BackgroundImage
                - ofa-LastBackupFolder
                - ofa-LastExportFolder
                - ofa-LastImportFolder
                - ofa-OpeTemplateBookOrder
                - ofa-UserPreferences-settings
                - OpeTemplateBookOrder
     2016-12-18 note that updating dossier settings triggers a reload
                of dossier_collection (due to file monitoring)
     2017- 2- 6 we also need an ofaIDBConnect opened connection on the dosier

1239 2016-10-19 export from EntryPage

1243 2016-10-22 have a command-line tool which displays the version of
                each of the DBModels of a saved database

1255 2016-11-13 have a setting per dossier to automatize backups path and name
     2016-11-17 path is nonetheless kept from last function call
                so only name has to be configurable

1260 2016-11-17 ebp2013 reprise is empty (no entries nor ledger)
                => have recovery assistant
     2017- 2- 1 TODO: insert entry in a non-opened dossier...
     2017- 2- 5 main issue is that allocated entry numbers will most
                probably overlap the numbers of the current exercice;
                this would be bad; the most obvious solution would be
                to have only one dossier table for all known exercices. 

1261 2016-11-17 Have a backup option to save all available periods
                + have an option to save this choice (do not automatically save)

1263 2016-11-19 DBMS: store documents
                + attach documents via an interface to:
                - BAT: the original imported document from the bank,
                - operations: the bill, or the purchase trace
                - entries: idem operation,
                - accounts: all documents for this account
     2017- 2- 6 dbms is prepared
     2017- 3-16 do not omit to check for deletabilityo of all objects
                which might have a document

1296 2016-12-17 VAT declarations: be able to consult generated operations

1344 2017- 2- 3 re-authorize dossier open from command-line

1350 2017- 2- 8 CheckBalances: check account and ledger archives

1351 2017- 2- 9 Review export and import formats, especially the tables
                with children and companions (e.g. entries+concil)
                + have a version number

1369 2017- 2-20 recurrent operations validation: cancelled operations
                should be italic+grayed

1379 2017- 3- 9 VatForm: set template column to fixed width, rather expand label

1385 2017- 3-15 have a printing with solde at the beginning + solde of
                entries = solde at the end of the period

1396 2017- 3-16 check conciliation groups integrity is wrong
                - display erroneous orphan conciliation member with BatLineId xxx
                - count is wrong
                + anyway, this cannot be really done while the exercice has
                not been rightly archived

1397 2017- 3-16 when deleting an entry, must actually delete the operation
                force this behavior unless otherwise specified

1401 2017- 3-16 export accounts at least with opening balance

1402 2017- 3-17 when generating the ODs for non-deductible CSG, should
                also generate an OD for deductible CSG to 629 account 

1409 2017- 3-22 dbms integrity: whether to display all messages or only
                errors should be a user preference

1410 2017- 3-24 export fec should be a plugin (new ofaIExporter interface)

1411 2017- 3-24 when a specific format is provided, should also provide
                a stream format with user-updatable fields

1412 2017- 3-24 record the new stream formats in user settings
                + replace the GtkEntry with a GtkComboBox+GtkEntry
                (this is for new profiles)

1416 2017- 3-24 dossier administrative credentials: does not remember the account

1417 2017- 3-24 ope_template: have a tiers id field depending of the template
     2017- 3-25 dbms is updated

1418 2017- 3-24 ope template has a prof. share (quote-part pro)
     2017- 3-25 dbms is updated

1420 2017- 3-29 reconciliation render should take the last BAT solde at
                the requested date (not the last last)

 553 2015- 1- 6 deleting a dossier only removes its references from
