# The goal is to have a single source tree, being able to be easily
# built in a virtual guest which only has a read access to the source
# tree
# -> run-distcheck.sh and run-autogen.sh are only executed on the
#    maintainer development box (and thus are installed in maintainer/
#    directory), while run-configure.sh is meant to build
#    from anywhere (thus simulating the packager machine), and is so
#    created at the root of the source tree)
# -> on the maintainer development box, _build/ and _install/ are
#    subdirectories of the root source tree
# -> on the virtual guests simulating packager machines, _build/ and
#    _install/ are subdirectories of the current working directory when
#    running run-configure.sh
