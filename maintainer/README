 development rules
 =================

 Development rules are written on top on each UI header.

 type:
   part_of: also said as 'composite' widget, this is expected to be
            included in another, more toplevel, widget;
            also said as a piece - or a part - of a bigger widget or
            dialog
   dialog:  a dialog box

 parent:
   type='part_of': the name of the widget which is to be extracted from
                   the definition, to be added to the toplevel parent
                   widget

 change:
   type='part_of': the composite widget should send an 'ofa-changed'
                   signal when a field is modified

 validation:
   type='part_of': if subject to validation, then the composite widget
                   should have a 'is_valid' method which:
                   - returns a boolean
                   - takes a gchar ** argument to return an error
                     message

 settings:
   whether this widget reads or writes its arguments to settings
   type='part_of': settings key should be provided by the caller
