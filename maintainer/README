 maintainer/
 ===========

 This directory contains some development tools which are expected to
 be used only by the maintainer.
 These tools are not distributed in the tarball, and are only present
 in the source repository.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 development rules
 =================

 Development rules are written on top on each UI header.

 type:
   bin:    a GtkBin-derived class which embeds a 'top' toplevel widget;
           it is expected to be used as a component/part/piece of a 
           more toplevel widget or dialog.
   dialog: a dialog box

 parent:
   type='bin': the name of the toplevel widget which is to be extracted
               from the .xml UI definition to be added to the parent
               container;
               this is usually a GtkGrid named 'top'.

 validation:
   type='bin': if subject to validation, then the GtkBin-derived widget
               should have a 'is_valid' method which:
               - returns a boolean
               - takes a gchar ** argument to return an error message;
               the mention 'with 'ofa-changed' signal' specifies the
               signal sent on the GtkBin-derived widget when its content
               changes.

 settings:
   whether this widget reads or writes its arguments to settings;
   this is usually not the case of the GtkBin-derived widgets but - this
   should happen - the settings key should be provided by the caller.

 current:
   whether this widget is subject to special display (typically read-
   only) depending of runtime conditions (eg. whether the dossier is
   current or archived);
   this is usually not the case of GtkBin-derived widgets, whose
   editability status is taking care by the embedding dialog.
