/**
 * SECTION: ofa_formula
 * @short_description: Formula functions
 * @include: openbook/ofa-formula.h
 *
 * The formula engine is able to evaluate formulas which are found in
 * operation template, VAT forms and so on.
 *
 * It is based on a sample macro language, and acts recursively.
 *
 * The evaluation of a formula gives a string, which may or may not be
 * evaluated depending of whether we have been able to get all needed
 * datas.
 *
 * A formula begins with equal ('=') sign. To begin any string with an
 * equal sign without tranforming it in a formula, just prefix it with
 * a single quote (e.g. "'=this is not a formula").
 *
 * Leading and terminating spaces are silently ignored.
 *
 * A formula is build around functions and arithmetic signs, where:
 * - exammples of functions may be:
 *   %RATE(...)
 *   %ACCOUNT(...)
 *   etc.
 * - arithmetic signs
 *
 * The caller must provide the function with the set of known functions
 * it is willing to deal with. In this set, function names may be
 * abbreviated as long as they stay unique.
 *
 * Functions (resp. macros) are identified as the '%' sign, followed by
 * the function (resp. macro) name. Functions must immediately follows
 * with an opening parenthesis.
 *
 * A macro is the same as a function, but does not take any argument.
 * It is expected to be evaluable in the global scope of the current
 * call. Macro are just special functions with zero argument.
 *
 * The string returned by each function is reinjected into the original
 * formula and re-evaluated. It may thus be a shortcut to a more complex
 * formula.
 *
 * Formula evaluation may return with a set of error messages.
 * This set must be released by the caller with #g_list_free_full( list, ( GDestroyNotify ) g_free ).
 *
 * v54 known functions
 * -------------------
 *
 * Operation template
 *
 *    A reference to another field of the operation;
 *    these tokens are single-uppercase-letter, immediately followed
 *    by the number of the row, counted from 1:
 *       - 'Ai': account number
 *       - 'Li': label
 *       - 'Di': debit
 *       - 'Ci': credit
 *       E.g.: the '%A1' string (without the quotes) will be substituted
 *             with the account number from row nÂ° 1.
 *
 *    2/ a reference to a global field of the operation
 *       - 'OPMN':    operation template mnemo
 *       - 'OPLA':    operation template label
 *       - 'LEMN':    ledger mnemo
 *       - 'LELA':    ledger label
 *       - 'REF':     the operation piece reference
 *       - 'DOPE':    operation date (format from user preferences)
 *       - 'DOMY':    operation date as mmm yyyy
 *       - 'DEFFECT': effect date (format from user preferences)
 *       - 'SOLDE':   the solde of the entries debit and credit to balance
 *                    the operation
 *       - 'IDEM':    the content of the same field from the previous row
 *
 *       Other keywords are searched as rate mnemonics (as a convenient
 *       shortcut to RATE() function).
 *
 *    3/ a function, arguments being passed between parenthesis:
 *       - 'ACLA()': returns account label
 *       - 'ACCU()': returns account currency
 *       - 'EVAL()': evaluate the result of the operation
 *                   may be omitted when in an amount entry
 *       - 'RATE()': evaluates the rate value at the operation date
 *                   may be omitted, only using %<rate> if the
 *                   'rate' mnemonic is not ambiguous
 *       - 'ACCL()': the closing account for the currency of the specified
 *                   account number
 *
 * VAT forms
 *
 *    1/ a function, arguments being passed between parenthesis:
 *       - 'CODE()':    identifies the rows whose 'Code' column holds the value
 *       - 'ACCOUNT()': returns the rough+validated balance of the account
 *       - 'AMOUNT():
 *       - 'BASE()':
 *
 * BNF formulation
 * ---------------
 *
 * OPERATOR OP ::= "+" | "-" | "/" | "*"
 *    addition | substraction | division | product
 *    precedences are:    "*" "/"
 *               then:    "+" "-"
 *
 * FORMULA ::= "=" <content> [ OP <content [ ... ]]
